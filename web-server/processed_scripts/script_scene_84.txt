Scene 84: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
END FLASHBACK. Marta in the same spot, Fran still talking
her ear off. The room sways. Marta sucks in breath, sways,
and braces herself against the wall.
FRAN
Oh my god Marta, what?
Meg runs over, rubs her back.
MEG
Whoa hey, c'mere, hey. What do you,
you want water? Breathe. Hey. Fran
have you still got your stash?
