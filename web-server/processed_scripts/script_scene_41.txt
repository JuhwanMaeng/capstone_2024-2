Scene 41: EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY
Blanc, Elliott and Wagner stroll long the wide lawn beside
the house. Blanc ignites a long thin cigar.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Maybe I'm a victim of my own
expectations. But when the great
Benoit Blanc knocks on my door, I
expect it's going to be for
something... if not extraordinary,
at least interesting. This is an
open and shut case of suicide.

And Benny we're at the point where I
need to know what we're doing here.
Blanc notices the OLD BASEBALL lying in the grass. He picks
it up idly.
BLANC
The method, throat slit. Typical of
a suicide?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Dramatic. But look around. The guy
practically lives in a CLUE board.
