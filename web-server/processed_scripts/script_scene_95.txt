Scene 95: INT. GUARD HOUSE
Thrombey's security man, MR PROOFROC, guides them into the
cramped dusty space. Proofroc is old and salty. He shows
them old photos of the house, stuck to a steel fridge with
big brightly colored fruit magnets.
MR PROOFROC
Fifty years I worked this estate, you
know security back then meant making
the rounds with a 94, keeping your
ears open. Before all this modern
technology.
Nothing in the room is newer than 1988. An 8 inch CRT
monitor shows a phosphorescent live feed of the road outside
the gate, and a top loaded VHS VCR sits next to it.
MR PROOFROC (cont'd)
Well the video here, I saved the tape
from that night, usually I erase 'em
with the magnetic de-gauser, but I
thought better save that one. Cause,
security. That's the live feed
there.
Marta notices something with alarm - the video feed shows
the road outside, and at the top edge you can just barely
see the carved elephant that marks the gardener's utility
road. She realizes Harlan said
HARLAN (V.O.)
...to avoid the security cameras,
pull off the road AFTER the carved
elephant.
Marta keeps a poker face, but.. shit.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
to Proofroc( )
Can we see the actual TAPE?
MR PROOFROC
Oh sure.
CLACK! The tape loads into the mechanical VCR. An
impossibly grainy, smeared night vision view of the road
outside the gate. Time stamp: 10:02pm.
TROOPER WAGNER
It's like a Japanese horror movie.
MR PROOFROC
proud( )
I record it SSLP, gets eight hours
per tape. Nine pm to five am.
BLANC
Can we -
to Marta( )
Can we scan forward?
MARTA
to Proofroc( )
Can we scan forward?
MR PROOFROC
Hold the play button down and press
the FF down halfway till you feel it
grind.
Wagner does, the machine makes horrible noises and the
picture frizzles and frazzles. Then stops and ejects.
MR PROOFROC (cont'd)
And hold the tape down or it'll
eject.
BLANC
Can your guys digitize it so we can
scan it properly?
TROOPER WAGNER
I'm sure we can.
MARTA
I got it.
Marta grabs the tape from the VCR.
