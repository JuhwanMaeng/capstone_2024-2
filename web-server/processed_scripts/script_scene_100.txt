Scene 100: INT. LIVING ROOM
Walt, Donna and Jacob (nose in his phone) sit around the
room. Linda and Richard stand, on their phones. Ransom
breezes in, bumping Donna who YELPS, startled.
Elliott and Wagner follow.
TROOPER WAGNER
Sir excuse me, we are officers of the
law.
RANSOM
You gonna run me in? I don't feel
like talking. I'm distraught.
Ransom disappears into the kitchen, comes out eating a
sleeve of pinwheel cookies.
Blanc and Marta slip in. Elliott nods to Blanc.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc, anything you need to ask him?
RANSOM
The hell anyway is this arrangement?
BLANC
Mr. Drysdale
Ransom sizes up Blanc with a grin.
RANSOM
CSI KFC?
Ransom grabs Fran the housekeeper's sleeve as she walks by.
RANSOM (cont'd)
Hey Frannie can you get me a glass of
cold milk?
Meg and Joni have just entered, and Meg heard this.
MEG
Hey asshole. Not her name, not her
job.
Fran walks off with a scorching look at Ransom.
RANSOM
Meg. How's your SJW degree coming?
MEG
Trust fund prick. JONI
Alright. Guys.
ALAN STEVENS, the family's attorney, knocks and enters with
an assistant, SALLY, who juggles several attache cases.
ALAN
Hey everyone. Hey. I'm just going
to set up in the other room, be ready
in ten minutes.
They go off to the library, leaving the family all together
in tense silence.
WALT
Funny Ransom, you skipped the funeral
but you're early for the will
reading.
JONI
Ok, people grieve in different ways,
let's not
WALT
to Ransom( )
It's funny you're here at all. Why
are you even bothering, that's what I
want to know.
RICHARD
What's that supposed to mean?
WALT
He knows what it means.
LINDA
Walt, what?
WALT
Jacob was in that bathroom the night
of the party.
JONI
Is that where you were all night?
RICHARD
The hell were you doing in the
bathroom all night?
JACOB
Nothing.
MEG
Swatting Syrian refugees.
JACOB
No.
MEG
Alt right troll.
JACOB
Liberal snowflake.
WALT
I don't know what any of that means
RICHARD
It means your son's a little creep.
WALT
Oh MY son's a creep?
JONI
Guys! Walt he was in the bathroom...
WALT
He was in the bathroom
RICHARD
Joylessly masturbating to pictures of
dead deer.
WALT
Ok you wanna go?
They go at each other and do some half-hearted slap-fighting
before Linda and Joni break them apart. Ransom's loving
this.
RANSOM
We gotta do this more often.
LINDA
Alright! Enough. Jacob, we get
where this is going. The bathroom's
next to Harlan's office, where he had
the big fight with Ransom. You heard
something. Spill it.
JACOB
I just heard two things.
