Scene 127: INT. MARTA'S CAR
MARTA
Holy shit. This is insane.
Ransom looks at her - yeah it's likely. They both
instinctively duck down in case the cops look over.
MARTA (cont'd)
Who would blow up a whole real
official building just to blackmail
me?
RANSOM
Marta this means that the blackmailer
has the only paper copy of the thing
that can prove your guilt. You didn't
get any other instructions, no phone
call no email, no nothing?
Marta looks stunned. She stabs at her phone, quick swipes.
MARTA
...nothing...I didn't check my email.
She shows him an email from 092832@shushmail.com. No
subject line, simple text: 1209 Columbus Rd 10AM
RANSOM
That's it. 1209 Columbus Road, 10am.
Marta looks at Ransom, then at the clock on her dashboard -
9:32, then at the charred building.
