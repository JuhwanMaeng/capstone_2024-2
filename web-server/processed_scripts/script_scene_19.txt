Scene 19: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
The exact same moment we saw with Richard and Linda of
Harlan in front of the birthday cake - but now it's Walt,
Donna and Jacob next to Harlan.
WALT (V.O.)
I mean. We're all gutted but I'm
happy we got that night with him. To
be by his side, to think about our
books and what we've accomplished
with them, it's like I can still feel
his hand on my shoulder.
