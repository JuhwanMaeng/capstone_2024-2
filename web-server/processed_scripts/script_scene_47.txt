Scene 47: EXT. PATIO - DAY
Marta's face works against impending nausea.
MARTA
I...
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Ok don't answer that if you're going
to puke. Please.
But Blanc presses.
BLANC
Meg said Harlan pays the school
directly, Joni says he sends the
money to her. Both were true, she
was pocketing the double payment,
Harlan found out and cut her off
without a cent. Yes?
Marta starts to shake her head no, but her throat convulses.
She nods. Blanc hands her a glass of water.
TROOPER WAGNER
And she bumps him off for the
inheritance? Come. On! Have you
seen her insta? She's an influencer.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
An allowance as a motive, Blanc. She
has her business. More weak sauce.
Blanc idly scratches a spot on the side of his neck.
BLANC
Granted. But she lied. To me. All
three of them did.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Three?
BLANC
Walter.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I see where you are going with this.
BLANC
But there was something else. Harlan
had turned Walter down before
regarding film rights, but that night
something Harlan said shook him. We
look at the pattern, Harlan was
cleaning house. I wonder...
to Marta( )
did he plan to fire Walter?
MARTA
honest & relieved( )
Can I wait inside? I don't feel like
I should be here.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Yes, please just wait inside but stay
close.
She steps back in, grateful. Blanc to Elliott:
BLANC
You've been very patient my friend,
and you are right, none of these weak
alibis and domestic squibbles answer
your question: why is Benoit Blanc
here? But now I will tell you why.
beat( )
I am here because this morning
someone dodged one very important
question.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Who?
BLANC
Me. Linda asked who hired me.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So who hired you?
BLANC
I. Do. Not. Know. An envelope of
cash showed up at my apartment
yesterday, with the news clipping of
Thrombey's death.
TROOPER WAGNER
An envelope? That worked?
BLANC
An envelope of cash.
Blanc indicates with his fingers - several inches thick.
BLANC (cont'd)
So somebody suspects foul play, but
goes through this ha cha dance of
hiring me, of staying anonymous. It
makes no damn sense. Compels me
though. (MORE)
beat( )BLANC (cont'd)
Walk me through everyone's
whereabouts at the time of death.
Elliott hesitates, but Blanc's got him hooked. He flips
open his notebook. Blanc leans back, closes his eyes.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
We know, the party broke up at 11:30.
