Scene 166: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
Moonlit, silent.
BLANC (V.O.)
Much later that night you would have
to come back to the house, to break
back in and retrieve the
incriminating tampered vials.
A dark figure, Ransom, approaches the side gate. But when
he opens it, the two dogs come bounding across the lawn,
barking loudly.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
However, this time the dogs were
outside. They barked. Waking Meg.
A light goes on upstairs. The dogs keep barking, paws on
the gate. Ransom backs off.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
No matter. You'll get the vials
tomorrow.
