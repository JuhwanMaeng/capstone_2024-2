Scene 25: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
The family is engaged in an animated discussion, Marta
standing on the outskirts.
RICHARD (V.O.)
I guess. Harlan hired her to be
around, take care of whatever medical
needs pop up, but really she's like
part of the family.
Richard beckons with his cake, calls Marta into the
discussion, into the circle of the family.
RICHARD (V.O.) (cont'd)
Good kid, been a good friend to
Harlan. Her family's from Paraguay.
Linda really likes her work ethic.
