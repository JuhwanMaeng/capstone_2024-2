Scene 137: EXT. PARKING LOT
Ransom and Marta step out of the car, hands raised for some
reason.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
That was the dumbest car chase of all
time. Put your hands down.
BLANC
to Marta( )
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey,
Greatnana. The night of the party
she saw someone climb the trellis to
the third floor.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Mr. Drysdale, come with us please.
Elliott leads Ransom off by the elbow. Ransom throws a look
back at Marta - he has no idea what's going on.
MARTA
What's going on?
BLANC
"Ransom came back" she said. I don't
know what he came back to do, but
we'll find out.
Marta looks at Ransom - oh no. Senile Greatnana thought she
was him. This is a mistake. But... she glances at her
watch - 9:51.
BLANC (cont'd)
Did he ask you to drive when he saw
me coming?
Ransom's being led to the police car. Marta decides:
MARTA
Yes.
Marta gets back in her car. She pretends to take a sip from
an empty soda cup, but actually SPITS UP a little into it.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (O.S.)
Blanc. Coming with us?
BLANC (O.S.)
to Elliott( )
I'll drive with Marta.
To Marta's horror Blanc opens her passenger door.
BLANC
Let's go to the police station, I
want a full run down of everything he
said to you, and I can catch you up
on where we're at.
