Scene 40: INT. SMALL STUDY
LINDA (O.S.)
Richard!
Alone, Richard waits very still for Linda's footsteps to
walk away, then when he knows she's not coming in he
furtively rifles through desk drawers, finding various
ridiculous ephemera. He finds a small locked drawer,
jimmies it open with a letter opener.
Inside - the small pink envelope Harlan threatened him with
in his flashback. He rips it open, pulls out the card
inside.
It is blank.
Richard almost laughs. Drops it onto the desk.
RICHARD
Son of a bitch.
He spots Harlan's old baseball. Grabs it, spitefully chucks
it out the open window.
