Scene 8: INT. CABRERA KITCHEN - MORNING
Marta sits in front of a laptop. Her MOM is at the table
with her, her sister ALICE watches CSI on an iPad on the
counter top. Murder related dialog from the show.
Marta scroll through a jobs site, tired, eyes dead. Her mom
watches, concerned.
MOM

ALICE

room so it doesn't play it's
like two minutes left what

MOM

Turn it off. Now.
Alice. Off.
They're talking about murder

a friend she loves slit his
throat open she doesn't need
to be hearing that right now

Mom standing yelling, Alice slams the iPad cover closed.
Marta puts her head in her hand. Looks at her mom, who
looks back at her with protective sympathy. Marta starts
laughing at the absurdity of it, but the laugh turns into
crying.
MARTA

ALICE
