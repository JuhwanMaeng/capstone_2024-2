Scene 78: INT. LIBRARY - LATE AFTERNOON
Blanc catches his coin. Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper
Wagner look up at Marta, expectant. Just a brief moment has
passed since we left them.
MARTA
I took him upstairs. We played our
nightly game of GO, at some point he
knocked the board over and Joni came
up to check on us. Then I gave him
pain medication, he pulled his
shoulder last week, and left him in
his study. At midnight. Said bye to
Walt, went home.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
What medication did he get?
Marta chooses her words very carefully:
MARTA
Since his injury I've been giving him
a 100 milligram IV push of Toradol, a
non narcotic analgesic. And to help
him sleep, 3 milligrams of morphine.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Anything unusual about his demeanor?
Uh oh. Marta keeps it solid. Superhuman effort.
MARTA
No.
The three men nod. Blanc holds Marta's gaze. She holds it
right back. Then he smiles.
BLANC
Well that sounds about right. Thank
you Ms. Cabrera.
