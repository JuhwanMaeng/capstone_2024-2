Scene 26: INT. LIBRARY
RICHARD
"Immigrants - we get the job done."
From Hamilton.
Wagner gives him a smile to show he got the reference.
TROOPER WAGNER
Oh Hamilton!
RICHARD
I saw it at the public.
Cut to Linda back in the chair.
BLANC
May I just - and then I'll recede,
but as a self made man myself I have
to express my admiration for how
you've followed in your father's
footsteps.
LINDA
Thank you.
BLANC
Just marvelous. The whole family too.
Joni with her things, Walt with his
publishing empire.
LINDA
Well.
Blanc pauses. Doesn't push anything. Just waits a moment.
LINDA (cont'd)
Yes. I mean. Walt, yeah. He's done
well with what dad's given him.
Walt - not like it matters but he was
sort of adrift, dad gave him the job,
but really dad hands him a book twice
a year and Walt publishes it, I
mean... it's just not the same.
BLANC
But surely Walt runs the
merchandising, adaptations, film and
television rights...
Linda squints, narrowing her eyes on Blanc. Softly:
LINDA
Are you baiting me, Detective? You
know he doesn't, and you think I'm
dumb enough to be baited into talking
family business, into shit talking my
brother in front of a police
detective and a state trooper -
Richard in the chair.
RICHARD
Walt doesn't run shit! There are no
film or TV rights, Harlan's never
allowed any adaptations of his books.
Hates the idea.
BLANC
No!
RICHARD
Oh yeah! Drives Walt nuts, cause
that's where the real money's at.
When he gets a little Irish courage
in him he'll get into it with Harlan.
BLANC
Did he get "into it" at the party?
RICHARD
Oh my god.
