Scene 32: INT. LIBRARY
Richard in the chair.
BLANC
Speaking of getting into it, you were
at the house early to help the
caterer set up. Did you converse
with Harlan at that time?
RICHARD
He was there, we must have spoke.
BLANC
In his study?
RICHARD
I don't think so.
BLANC
You see, I spoke with the caterer
this morning. She didn't see you
helping her staff, but she did hear
Harlan in a screaming match with
someone that afternoon. In his study.
RICHARD
I don't, a screaming match? No.
Joni was here too, she was early,
maybe it was her, ask her.
BLANC
These were two male voices.
