Scene 122: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY
Dim and dingy. Marta comes out of their apartment door,
then jump, startled - at the end of the hall, lurking:
Walt.
MARTA
Hey.
Walt's eyes are rimmed red. His heavy cane taps.
WALT
Hey.
They're not sure what to do so they awkwardly hug. Marta
still has the envelopes in her hands.
WALT (cont'd)
How you doing?
MARTA
Well. Walt I want you to
know I didn't know about any
of this. This is
WALT
I know you didn't, we all
went kinda crazy yesterday
MARTA
Understandable
WALT
You're still very important to all of
us, I want you to know that.
MARTA
I haven't even looked at all this
yet, this legal stuff, is this from
you guys?
Marta flips through the envelopes, squinting.
WALT
it isn't from us. Maybe just local
lawyers and accountants who saw the
news and want to jump on it, I'd be
careful of it all.
One envelope sticks out - a blank plain letter sized
envelope, no postage, no return address.
WALT (cont'd)
Marta. Is it your intention to
renounce the inheritance?
MARTA
This is what Harlan wanted.
WALT
Well. Harlan has put you in a very
hard position here. It was unfair of
him.
Walt's hand on his cane. Gripping tight.
WALT (cont'd)
You see what this kicks up with the
press and the scrutiny, and we
know... with your mother...
MARTA
...with my mother.
Marta's spine straightens.
MARTA (cont'd)
What did Meg tell you.
WALT
This isn't about who - you're missing
the point, we're not attacking you
with this. (MORE)
Marta if your mom came here
WALT (cont'd)
illegally, criminally, if you come
into this inheritance with the
scrutiny that entails I'd be afraid
that could come to light. That's
what we're all trying to avoid here.
We can protect you from that
happening, or if it happens.
MARTA
You're saying even if it came to
light, with the family's resources
you could help me fix it.
WALT
Yes. The right lawyers, none of
those local guys but New York
lawyers, DC lawyers, enough resources
put towards it, yes. But there's no
need it should ever even come up.
But yes.
MARTA
Ok. Good.
WALT
Ok?
MARTA
Cause Harlan gave me all your
resources. So that means with my
resources I'll be able to fix it. So
I guess I'm going to go find the
right lawyers.
WALT
Marta.
He shuffles towards her. For the first time she feels a
hint of physical threat, and backs up quick into her
apartment.
WALT (cont'd)
You better be sure you want to -
She slams the door
