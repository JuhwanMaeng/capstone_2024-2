Scene 108: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE
Marta stumbles out of the house in a daze. Behind her, the
entirety of the family floods out after her, shouting
reassurances and questions and accusations and a general din
of confusion.
MARTA
I - I have no idea why he - I just
need to think - I'll call you or have
him call me or do something I don't
know
She gets in her car and slams the door, and it's instantly
like A Hard Day's Night - the family gathered around trying
to talk through the window and rapping to get her attention.
Marta keys the ignition - chug chug chug. Nothing. Oh god,
not now - chug chug chug. It won't turn over.
Richard opens the door, she pulls it closed again and locks
it, this is like a horror movie. Blanc is trying to get the
family to back off but no dice.
Marta puts her head in her hands, all of it swirling and
echoing and horrifying, she has no idea what to do.
HONK!
She turns - a honking car pulls up right beside her and
through the family crowd she sees Ransom in his Porsche,
waving "get in." With no other options she pushes out of
her car and through the family and JUMPS IN with him.
As he GUNS IT and careens out of the driveway he shouts back
at the family with a wave
RANSOM
I think this could be the best thing
to happen to all of you!
And they're gone. The family keeps shouting at each other.
Blanc watches the Porsche recede, his expression unreadable.
DING! His phone buzzing. He checks it. His expression
darkens.
