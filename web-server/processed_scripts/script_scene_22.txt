Scene 22: INT. LIBRARY - PRESENT
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Sorry, the Nugget of?
JONI
Flam.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Ah! Yeah Flam, right, your skin care
company. Sorry.
JONI
I forgive you, yes, it's skin care
but it promotes a total lifestyle.
Self sufficiency with an
acknowledgment of human need. That's
Flam, but it's also Harlan. He got
me and Meg through some tough times.
Meg in the chair.
MEG
Granddad gives my mom a yearly
allowance, and he's never missed
wiring a tuition payment to my
schools. He's a genuinely selfless
man.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
You left his party early?
MEG
To see some friends at Smith.
