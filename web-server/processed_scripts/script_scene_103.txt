Scene 103: EXT. FRONT PORCH
Blanc breathes in the air. Marta joins him. From inside
the house, the shouting continues.
MARTA
What was that about will readings
being boring?
BLANC
Exception that proves the rule.
Fran bursts out of the living room, muttering
FRAN
Asshole.
She storms off around the house. A beat of thought. Then:
BLANC
I'm warning you. Ransom said. I'm
warning you.
One of the dogs bounds up the steps to Blanc.
MARTA
You heard Ransom in there, it's the
kind of thing he says.
When Blanc goes to pet him, the dog drops something to his
feet with a clatter. Marta freezes.
MARTA (cont'd)
What's he got there? Hey boy. You
find a stick? He's always bringing
junk into the house -
It's the piece of broken trellis. Blanc picks it up,
examines it, and suddenly his eyes go sharp.
