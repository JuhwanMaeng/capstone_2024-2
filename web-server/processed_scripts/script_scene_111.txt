Scene 111: INT. RESTAURANT - CORNER BOOTH
Tucked into a dark corner, Marta is miserable. Ransom is
bemused, but regards her closely.
They sit in silence. A waitress sets a sausage plate down.
RANSOM
to the waitress( )
Could we get an extra bowl please?
to Marta( )
You look like you're gonna pass out.
Have you eaten all day? Eat.
She joylessly shovels food in her mouth, starving.
MARTA
This is a nightmare.
RANSOM
Uh huh. So why.
MARTA
Why
RANSOM
Why. Hey, this is everything. There
has to be a bigger reason why and you
know it.
MARTA
Well Ransom how about it had more to
do with you guys than with me.
RANSOM
agrees( )
Yeah. beat( )
Yeah that's the only thing that makes
sense.
Marta is unexpectedly effected by this. The waitress
breezes by, sets an empty bowl on the table.
MARTA
Did he tell you anything?
RANSOM
Just I wasn't getting a cent.
MARTA
He wanted you to build
something from the ground
up, like your parents
RANSOM
something from the ground
up, like my parents
RANSOM (cont'd)
yeah. My mom built her business from
the ground up with a million dollar
loan from granddad. My dad owns none
of it, and mom made him sign a
prenup. He lives in fear.
I know that's what granddad wanted to
protect me from by doing this, and I
know I shouldn't say this out loud
but when he told me, Jesus Christ I
coulda killed him.
beat( )
After I left the party, though. I
was driving fast, nowhere, just in
the night. And I got this weird...
clarity. That from here on I was
going to have to do for myself. And
that felt... good. The old bastard.
beat( )
Marta I know three things. One: I
know he didn't commit suicide.
MARTA
What makes you think that
RANSOM
I don't think it. I know it. Cause
I knew my granddad. So you're not
going to bullshit me. Because two:
I know lying makes you puke. Cause
of that mafia game last fourth of
July.
Marta sinks back, suddenly nervous.
RANSOM (cont'd)
And three. I know that you just ate
a full plate of sausage and baked
beans.
She looks down at her empty plate. Oh no. He pushes the
large empty bowl in front of her.
RANSOM (cont'd)
So look me in the eye. And tell me
what really happened to my granddad.
Her lip quivers. She looks like she might attempt it. But
then tears drop from her eyes.
MARTA
You bastard.
Ransom pull the bowl away, and puts his hand on hers.
RANSOM
Marta. Tell me everything.
