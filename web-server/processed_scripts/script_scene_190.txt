Scene 190: INT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD - FLASHBACK
Marta turns away from the dying Fran.
BLANC (V.O.)
And if Marta had not outplayed you
once again.
Marta turns back, calls 911, gives mouth to mouth to Fran.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
By having a kind heart. By saving
Fran's life, though it meant her
losing the inheritance and going to
jail. She didn't play your game, she
saved Fran's life.
