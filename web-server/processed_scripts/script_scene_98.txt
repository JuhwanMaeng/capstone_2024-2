Scene 98: INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY
The blood is now only a subtle dark stain, but other than
that the room has been left intact from the night of the
party. Marta and Wagner observe as Blanc paces the room.
BLANC
to Marta( )
Where's your medical bag?
MARTA
I... don't know - I left it here, I
always leave it with Harlan at night.
TROOPER WAGNER
They must have taken it in as
evidence. I'll check on it.
Blanc picks up the GO board and sets it on the table.
Examines its grid idly.
BLANC
How'd the GO board get knocked over?
MARTA
We were just goofing around.

What are you thinking?
Blanc sighs gently, turns the baseball over in his hands.
Looks like this was a bust.
Blanc tips the GO board over, and it lands on the carpet
with a nearly inaudible WHOMPH. He stares at it.
But his concentration is broken by sharp barking outside.
They go to the tiny window and look out. A DASHING MAN in
his early 30s climbs out of a vintage Porsche. The dogs go
NUTS, biting at his pant legs.
BLANC
Let me guess.
