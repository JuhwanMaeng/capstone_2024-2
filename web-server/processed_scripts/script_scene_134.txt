Scene 134: INT. MARTA'S CAR
Marta's speedometer creeping up on 55.
MARTA
Oh my god oh my god oh my
god I am literally flooring
it
RANSOM
Are you flooring it?
Her phone rings - Blanc again. She looks over - cop cars
are RIGHT ALONGSIDE them. Blank holds his phone up, looks
at her quizzically. Points to the phone.
RANSOM (cont'd)
This is going well.
MARTA
This is stupid, I'm pulling over
RANSOM
If you miss your shot at getting that
tox report it's all over...
MARTA
Aaauuuuuawwwaaagghhhh
She hits the brakes.
