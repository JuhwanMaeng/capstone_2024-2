Scene 113: INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Lit by a fire in the fireplace, the whole family pacing
around, Alan the lawyer looking very tired seated at a table
in the center of the room.
ALAN
If Harlan was of sound mind when he
made the changes, and we've all
confirmed he was
RICHARD
Would a sound person do
this! Sound how?
LINDA
The very action speaks to
unsoundness!
ALAN
not legally no, you not liking what
they did does not speak to
testamentary capacity.
JACOB
What about undue influence?
WALT
Yes! Undue influence!
ALAN
weary( )
Did you just google that?
WALT
If Marta was manipulating dad
somehow, if we found out that she had
LINDA
Gotten her hooks into him WALT
Somehow or something
ALAN
You need a strong case for that.
You've got nothing. "She endeared
herself to him through hard work and
good humor" won't cut the salami.
JONI
What about the slayer rule?
All eyes turn to her. Her face is lit by her phone.
JONI (cont'd)
I did just google that.
ALAN
The slayer rule obviously does not
apply here.
RICHARD
What the hell is the slayer rule?
JONI
It's if someone is convicted of
killing the person they can't get
their inheritance.
ALAN
Not even convicted, even if they're
held responsible for their death in
civil court
WALT
Like OJ ALAN
Like OJ, yes. But Harlan
committed suicide.
All eyes turn to Blanc, who this whole time has been sitting
in a chair by the fire, lost in thought.
JONI
Detective Blank. You said that the
investigation is continuing. You
made a point of that. Do you suspect
foul play?
BLANC
Mister Blanc. If you please.
beat( )
There is much that remains unclear.
But yes. I suspect foul play.
The eruption you would expect breaks out.
RICHARD
Marta?
BLANC
I have eliminated no suspects.
RICHARD
You're full of shit, I don't trust
this guy in the tweed suit, and Alan
god bless you you're useless.
ALAN
Thank you.
Alan takes that as an excuse to leave.
RICHARD
There's one answer to this: she can
renounce the inheritance.
WALT
She knows it's what she
should do, it's the right
thing to do.
LINDA
We've gotta make her do the
right thing.
Meg rounds on her mom, speaks quietly, in tears.
MEG
Mom. If Granddad wanted Marta to
have everything, that's what he
wanted.
JONI
No, this was not him. He loved us,
he wanted us taken care of. He
wanted you to have an education.
(MORE)
Meg. You think I can pay for your
JONI (cont'd)
school?
This leaves Meg shaken.
