Marta come down the stairs, and sees the outline of Walt and
Jacob outside through the glazed window windows.
HARLAN (V.O.)
...through the glazed window.
She holds her breath, a deer in the headlights.
WALT
Dad, go to bed.
Marta heads right back up the stairs.
HARLAN (V.O.)
You were seen leaving, the security
cameras show you driving off, and
twenty minutes later I am seen alive
and well by my son.
