Scene 107: INT. LIBRARY - MINUTES LATER
The whole family assembled. Marta stands in the back, with
Blanc, Elliott and Trooper Wagner.
Alan Stevens, Harlan's attorney, sits at a table with papers
in front of him, assistant Sally beside him.
ALAN
Well. Thank you all for getting
together like this, it isn't legally
necessary but I thought because
you're all in town and some of you
are leaving soon, it would be best -
BLANC
Excuse me Mr. Stevens. As to that,
ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
gently request you all remain in town
until the investigation is completed.
Shouldn't be more than two days.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
He's gently requesting, I'm ordering.
Nobody move until we figure this out.
Nobody likes this.
LINDA
What?
JONI
Can we ask why? Has something
changed?
BLANC
No.
JONI
No it hasn't changed or no we can't
ask?
BLANC
Mr. Stevens, please continue.
ALAN
Right. Well the other reason I
thought this gathering would be, uh,
beneficial is that as I told Walt,
Harlan altered his will one week ago.
He sealed it and asked me not to
submit it to the courts for probate
until after his death. So in case
there's any confusion about anything
we're all together, we can talk. I
can't imagine any of it will be that
complicated, Harlan's assets included
um
SALLY
...the house
ALAN
the house which he owned outright, um
SALLY
sixty million
ALAN
right in various cash accounts and
investments, yes and of course the
real assets are sole ownership of um
SALLY
Blood Like Wine
ALAN
Blood Like Wine publishing, his
publishing company. Ok.
Walt's wife puts her hand on his knee. He squeezes it,
smiled tightly.
ALAN (cont'd)
Um, he did write up a statement when
he made the recent changes, he wanted
it read first, so:
reads( )
"Some of you may be surprised by the
choice I've made here. No pleasure
was taken in the exclusion, and its
purpose was not to sow greater
discord in the family, quite the
opposite. Please accept it with
grace and without bitterness. But do
accept it. It's for the best."
Gently condescending eyes shift to Ransom. Linda sees this,
puts her hand on her son's hand, and he immediately gets up
and moves to a chair in the corner.
Alan's assistant hands him an envelope and he removes a
single sheet of paper with one short typed paragraph.
ALAN (cont'd)
Ok. So - oh wow, yeah, not complex
at all. This'll be quick. "I Harlan
Thrombey, being of sound mind and
body, yada yada, my assets both
liquid and otherwise, I leave in
their entirety to Marta Cabrera. My
entire ownership of Blood Like Wine
publishing I leave in its entirety to
Marta Cabrera. The copyright of its
catalog likewise I leave in its
entirety to Marta Cabrera.
The air around Marta's head goes away. The room spins
She's not sure what's happening. Blanc is looking at her.
The whole family is looking at her.
Walt bursts out of his chair and grabs the will
WALT
No.
LINDA
No.
WALT
No. What?
beat( )
That can't be - that can't be right
RICHARD
What the genuine shit WALT
That can't be right it's
right
ALAN
It's right
Donna begins to hyperventilate. She puts her head between
her knees, breathes deep.
LINDA
No no no no Alan this can't be legal,
there are, we're his family
WALT
We're his family, Alan he
obviously wasn't,
something - I don't know
what but something wasn't
right here
RICHARD
Are there safeguards against
this?
And from the back of the room, slowly rising above the din
of confusion and cursing, slowly drawing even Marta's deer
in the headlights attention... Ransom. LAUGHING. Loud and
weirdly sincerely, tears down his cheeks, laughing his head
off.
JONI
Alan there's a mistake
MEG
Mom if it's what granddad
wanted
JONI
No this is a mistake, this
is ours.
LINDA
Alan take that piece of paper and
shove it up your ass and get out.
And you cops, out!
They don't but Ransom slips out, his child-like laughter
trailing after him.
RICHARD
Linda -
LINDA
No, we need to talk and we need to
fight this thing and we're not going
anywhere. GET OUT! We're the
Thrombeys goddammit! This is still
our house!
A beat of silence. Then all eyes go to Alan. Who looks
down at the will. His assistant Sally points helpfully.
ALAN
Sorry, there's, uh. "Likewise the
house at two Deerborn Drive and all
belongings therein I leave to Marta
Cabrera.
Linda goes for Marta.
LINDA
You little bitch. Did you know about
this? What did you do to him to make
this happen, were you two what were
you boinking my father?
Marta recoils, stumbles back.
MEG
'Boinking?'
RICHARD
Linda!
JACOB
Anchor baby. WALT
Marta! Jacob! And Linda -
please!
JONI
Linda please - Marta, you need to
tell us though,
WALT
Yes Marta, did dad discuss
this with you?
JONI
You need to tell us
everything you know about
this and we need to talk
about this,
WALT
This isn't what dad wanted,
this isn't fair but we can
work this out
RICHARD
Jesus don't mob the girl,
let's talk about this
The whole family is coming towards her like zombies. Blanc
takes her by the arm and steers her towards the door.
BLANC
I think heads have to cool a little,
and in the meanwhile I'd maybe run.
