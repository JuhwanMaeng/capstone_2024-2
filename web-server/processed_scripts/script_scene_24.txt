Scene 24: INT. LIBRARY
JONI
I think Linda was upset. But Harlan
understood.
Tap.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Right. You two arrived together to
the party at the same time?
Joni looks at the linen suit man.
JONI
If I could - pause - because I, who
is that guy? And why are we doing
all this? Again?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Just some follow up questions, just
being thorough, in order to determine
the manner of death.
Cut back to Walt in the chair.
WALT
almost laughing( )
So by "manner of death" you mean if
he was killed. If one of us killed
him. One of his family?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
None of us think that, this is pro
forma, all of it.
CUT TO: Richard in the chair. He doesn't buy it.
RICHARD
Ok. So who the fuck is that?
He points at linen suit. Elliott takes a breath.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
This is Benoit Blanc.
RICHARD
the hell?( )
Benoit Blanc?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Yes. Mr. Blanc is a private
investigator of great renown.
Joni in the chair.
JONI
Wait a minute - I read a tweet about
a New Yorker article about you. The
last of the gentlemen sleuths? You
solved that case with the tennis
champ - you're famous!
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Mr. Blanc is not with the police
department, he is not officially
involved with the case but he has
offered to consult. I happily obliged
and I can vouch for him.
Linda in the chair.
LINDA
Mr. Blanc, I know who you are, I
read your New Yorker profile. It was
delightful. I just buried my eighty
five year old father who committed
suicide. Why are you here?
Elliott and Wagner turn back to Blanc, who leans forward
slightly and speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you have
ever heard in your life.
BLANC
I am here at the behest of a client.
LINDA
Who?
BLANC
I cannot say, but let me assure you
this: my presence will be
ornamental. (MORE)
You will find me a respectful, quiet,
BLANC (cont'd)
passive observer. Of the truth.
Elliott and Wagner turn nervously back to Linda. She
doesn't look thrilled. Cut to Richard.
RICHARD
Fine. Are we getting there?
BLANC
Nearly. Harlan's nurse. She was at
the party in a professional capacity?
Blanc begins idly playing with a silver dollar.
RICHARD
Marta?
