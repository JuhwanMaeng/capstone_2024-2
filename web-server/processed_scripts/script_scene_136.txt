Scene 136: INT. MARTA'S CAR
Marta, breathing hard. Ransom is shocked.
MARTA
Ok. I'm all just pure
adrenaline now it's like I
swallowed bees. What's the
the whatsitcalled address
ok. And I just - I mean
whatever they want, I just
say yes right, just to get
that report back.
And destroy it. Ransom.
Thank you. I couldn't do
this without you.
RANSOM
1209 Columbus road.
And destroy it.
He smiles slightly. A quick moment of silence between them.
Then: RAP RAP RAP on Ransom's car window.
Blanc. Standing right outside. Marta looks in her rear
view - the cop car has pulled up silently behind them.
Another pulls up in front.
