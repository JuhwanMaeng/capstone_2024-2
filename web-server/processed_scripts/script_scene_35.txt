That's none of your business, Harlan.
Stay out of my marriage.

embroidery, "L" written on the front.
HARLAN
I know my daughter. She'd want to
know. I've put it all in this letter
to her, tomorrow she gets it.

I'm warning you once, don't
do this like hell -

She deserves to know, you're
going to tell her!

You tell her or I will!
