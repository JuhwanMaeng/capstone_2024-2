Scene 152: INT. LIBRARY
Blanc steers Marta into the library, as sounds of hubub and
shouting come from the other room.
MARTA
What the hell? I want to come clean,
this is over -
BLANC
Almost.
Elliott bursts in, motions to the living room, then Marta,
then Blanc.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
What - with - what?
BLANC
I'm sorry - officer Wagner!
Wagner enters.
BLANC (cont'd)
Please keep the family out of this
room and get them out of the house if
you can. But stand by with your
additional officer.
TROOPER WAGNER
Get the family out?
BLANC
Yes but not all of them.
Blanc whispers something to Wagner, who nods and exits.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc c'mon, what's all this Drama.
BLANC
Indulge me.
Marta sits. Elliott remains standing.
MARTA
Blanc. I told Ransom, Ransom told
you, I'm telling you now - it is an
immovable fact that I killed Harlan.
BLANC
Yes you did, yes he did, yes you are,
but. But. (MORE)
I spoke in the car about the hole at
BLANC (cont'd)
the center of this donut. And yes,
what you and Harlan did that fateful
night seems at first glance to fill
that hole perfectly. A donut hole in
the donut's hole. But we must look a
little closer. And when we do, we
see that the donut hole has a hole in
its center - it is not a donut hole
at all but a smaller donut with its
own hole, and our donut is not whole
at all!
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc I understand that this is
amusing for you -
BLANC
Why. Was. I. Hired? Why would
someone hire me?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Someone fishing for any crime that
could help reverse the will.
BLANC
I was hired before the sealed will
was read. Yes, the person must have
known the contents of the will. But
one step further - that same person
must have known a crime was
committed, and further, if the intent
was to reverse Marta's inheritance,
they must have known that Marta was
responsible.
beat( )
An intriguing combination of factors.
Someone who knew what Marta did,
wanted to expose it, but could not
reveal how they knew.
MARTA
Fran? She was blackmailing me, she
knew what I did
BLANC
But Fran wanted money, ergo she did
not want the crime exposed.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Did someone in the family see Marta
doing something suspicious?
BLANC
They would have had no reason to not
speak up. No. The answer is not so
simple.
Blanc sits, suddenly weary.
BLANC (cont'd)
Now with the entire solution in my
field of view, the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors. And Marta,
it will not be easy to hear. But
there is at least one truly guilty
party behind it all, guilty in the
true sense of acting with malice, and
committing a heinous crime with
selfish intent.
calls( )
Trooper Wagner.
MARTA
stunned( )
Trooper Wagner??
Blanc squints at her. No.
A moment later Wagner leads Ransom in. Ransom looks at
Marta softly, sadly.
RANSOM
Marta I'm sorry. I told them
everything, I figured it was all up.
I'm sorry.
MARTA
It's alright Ransom, I'm glad you
did.
BLANC
Not exactly everything though.
MARTA
Is this about what Greatnana told
you? She saw me that night, she
mistook me for Ransom
BLANC
We'll get to that. But first, Mr.
Hugh Ransom Drysdale, you might tell
us all why you hired me.
RANSOM
Why I hired you?
BLANC
You're right, let's back up. To the
night of the party. Your argument
with Harlan. What were the overheard
words by the Nazi child masturbating
in the bathroom - "my will" and "I'm
warning you." You and Harlan were
"drama mamas," you shared a love of
twisting the knife into one another.
I don't believe he would have slipped
it in halfway - no, I submit that
Harlan told you everything.
