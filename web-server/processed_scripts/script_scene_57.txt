Scene 57: EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF PARTY
Walt, still smoking with Jacob, spots Harlan through the
glazed glass, coming down the stairs in the foyer.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Harlan. Who came down for midnight
snacks, which Walt tried to
discourage.
WALT
Dad, go to bed!
Through the glazed glass, Harlan goes back up the stairs.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Based on this, the medical examiner
determined time of death to be
between 12:15 and 2am. As Walt was
finishing his cigar, about 12:30, Meg
came home. She went straight to bed.
Walt and Jacob turned in shortly
after that.
Meg pulls up, trots past Walt and Jacob and inside.
