Scene 62: INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Harlan sits, setting up a GO board. Marta enters.
MARTA
It's late, I had champagne
no no no
HARLAN
It's my birthday, we are -
You had one glass - we're
not breaking tradition on my
birthday.
Marta puts two vials and a pill box on the GO board. She
pulls out two plastic wrapped hypodermics.
MARTA
Take your goddamn medicine and go to
bed.
HARLAN
If you're going to put that vile shit
in me you will have to earn it. On
my birthday.
playing it up( )
Eighty fifth. So old. Soo olddd
MARTA
Alright old man. 8x8 game. You
ready?
She sits and they start clacking white and black stones on
the board.
HARLAN
Why can't I beat you at this
game?
Oh uh huh.
MARTA
Because I'm not playing to
beat you, I'm playing to
build a beautiful pattern.
They play fast, and Marta is obviously winning.
HARLAN
Elder abuse. I'm calling the AARP.
MARTA
Don't make me get the belt.
HARLAN
It's basically over. My only hope is
that an earthquake will strike. But
what are the chances -
Harlan starts shaking the table with his knee. He looks
around, startled. Marta just stares at him, deadpan.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Get under a door frame!
He tips the whole table and the GO board and med vials and
syringe and med kit fall to the soft rug. Things spill out
of the kit. A mess. Marta just shakes her head.
MARTA
Meds then beds.
HARLAN
Fair.
She retrieves the vials and loads a syringe from one of
them. Harlan rolls up his sleeve revealing a pre-inserted
catheter. He crosses to close the room's only small window.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Ugh, Walt's smoking a cigar on the
porch. Nasty things.
MARTA
How was tonight?
She hooks the syringe up to the catheter and slowly injects
him bit by bit while he talks.
HARLAN
Tonight was... good.
MARTA
Because I know you weren't looking
forward to it.
HARLAN
No. But I did it. Cut the line on
all four of them. It was not easy.
This goddamn fortune. Sometimes I
think, everything I've given my
family, I've done, maybe without
knowing it, maybe, to keep them
beneath me. I should have what...
maybe, I don't know. Encouraged Walt
to write his own stories, not just be
a caretaker of mine. Like you said I
should. Been a father, not just a
provider, to Joni. Like you've also
said. I should have been kinder to
Linda. And Ransom.
Harlan takes a curved ornamental dagger from a display
mount, turns it over in his hands.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Jesus there's so much me in that kid.
Confident, stupid, I dunno.
(MORE)
Protected. Playing life like a game
HARLAN (cont'd)
without consequence, till you can't
tell the difference between a stage
prop and a real knife.
He stabs it into the desk, sharp and real. Leaves it there.
HARLAN (cont'd)
I don't fear death. But god I'd like
to fix some of this before I go.
Close the book with a flourish. I
guess we'll see.
MARTA
I guess we will. Hey. Old man.
You've had a long day. Wanna do
drugs.
She loads the second syringe from the second vial.
HARLAN
you mean the good stuff?
MARTA
Yeah but just a tiny bit.
HARLAN
Send me to lala land. Why did I wait
till my mid eighties to become a
morphine user, what a schmuck, what a
nud-nig, this stuff's the best.
She pulls the needle from the second vial... then sees the
label. Freezes. Blinks at it.
MARTA
Oh my god.
She snatches up the first vial she just injected him from.
Compares the label to the one she just picked up. They're
similar but not the same.
HARLAN
Is there a problem?
MARTA
This is what I just gave you 100
milligrams of. But I messed up.
HARLAN
You gave me 100 milligrams of the
good stuff.
She immediately pulls an EMERGENCY KIT from a nearby shelf,
starts calmly but quickly going through its contents.
HARLAN (cont'd)
What's the good stuff dosage supposed
to be?
MARTA
Lets not call it that right now -
three milligrams.
HARLAN
That's much less. So what happens?
MARTA
I give you an emergency shot of
Naloxone, so that you don't die in
ten minutes.
HARLAN
Well no pressure. You know that's an
interesting, efficient method for
murder, I need to write that down.
He gets a little notebook and scribbles while she checks and
rechecks the kit contents with increasing urgency.
HARLAN (cont'd)
So if someone switched the meds on
purpose I'd be dead in ten minutes,
like stone cold dead?
MARTA
You'll feel symptoms in five. Sweats,
disorientation. Then yeah, that big
a dose, injected, within ten your
respiratory - your - yes ten minutes.
HARLAN
From the time of injection, so
eightish now. And even if the victim
called an ambulance when he first
felt symptoms, if he was at a country
home like this one... where the
ambulance takes fifteen minutes to
arrive, it would be too late. If the
victim didn't have this emergency
Naxostuff.
He watches her. She's now digging around the carpet,
looking under the couch. She dumps the entire contents of
the kit out and is now frantically going through it. A bead
of sweat rolls down Harlan's brow.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Marta. Do you have Naxostuff?
MARTA
Yes! Naloxone yes it comes with the
emergency kit - it should be here,
it's - fuck. No Harlan it's not
here. It's not. Oh my god.
They look at each other for a second. She's panicked. He's
thinking.
MARTA (cont'd)
Where's my phone? Shit -
She picks up a landline phone on the table, dials 911 with
shaking hands -
Before it can even ring, the line goes dead.
She looks, unbelieving: Harlan's finger is on the cradle.
His eyes are locked with hers, serious and certain.
MARTA (cont'd)
Harlan what are you doing?
HARLAN
Marta, listen to me.
MARTA
Harlan we need to - are you
crazy, we need to call, they
need to get here I need to -
HARLAN
Stop. Stop stop, Marta
listen there isn't time stop
now stop
She goes for her cell phone across the room and Harlan stops
her - they trip and fall to the ground with a KA-THUNK.
MARTA
What are you doing are you
nuts?
HARLAN
Marta it's too late it is
over, it's too late I am
dead listen. LISTEN.
He actually puts his hand over her mouth.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Listen. If what you said is true I
am gone, there's no saving me, we
have six minutes. There is one last
thing I need to do in this world, and
only you can help me do it. But you
need to trust me and do everything I
say.
MARTA
What do you want to do?
HARLAN
Get you out of this. Think of your
mom - please trust me, we have to
make this look ironclad like it can't
have been your fault. You. Can't.
Have done this.
MARTA
My mom...?
CREAK on the stairs outside.
HARLAN
Get up.
A knock on the door.
JONI (O.S.)
Harlan? Marta? Everything alright?
Harlan and Marta stand. She's dazed, deer in the
headlights, but he's focused and sharp. He turns her away
from the door.
HARLAN
Stand here, keep your back to me,
don't say a word.
Harlan opens the door. While he gets rid of Joni we stick
with Marta, who stands stock still, tears running down her
face, eyes wild - what does she do?
HARLAN (cont'd)
Joni.
JONI
I - hi - I heard something, is
everything ok?
HARLAN
Oh yes we just, I just knocked over
the GO board, sorry about that.
JONI
Everything's alright?
HARLAN
Yes yes all fine, go to bed Joni.
JONI
Ok. And maybe we can talk tomorrow
about the, uh, the thing with
HARLAN
Yes. Tomorrow.
JONI
Love you, Night.
HARLAN
Night night.
Harlan shuts the door. Looks at the knife still sticking in
the desk. Then takes Marta's shoulders, looks in her eyes.
HARLAN (cont'd)
Pay attention now, your mom is still
undocumented, if this is your fault
she'll be found out and at best
deported, your family will be broken.
A new kind of fear in Marta's eyes.
MARTA
Oh god HARLAN
But we're not going to let
that happen. I have a plan,
it's not going to be easy
but you have to do exactly
what I tell you. Will you
do this Marta? This last
thing. For me, and for your
family.
She's terrified. But she nods.
MARTA
What do you want me to do?
