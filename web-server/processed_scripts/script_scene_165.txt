Scene 165: INT. LIBRARY
Marta with her fingers on her temples, still unbelieving.
RANSOM
Marta c'mon.
to Blanc( )
This is stoopid with two o's and you
don't have a shred of evidence,
you're just spinning a fairy tale.
BLANC
Not a shred no, just as we have no
real proof of Marta's mixing up the
vials so it's your word against -
RANSOM
You have her confession!
The sharpness of this makes Marta look at Ransom for the
first time.
BLANC
Ah right, we do have that. If you'll
indulge me, I'd like to spin a little
further.
