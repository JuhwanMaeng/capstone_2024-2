Scene 143: INT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD
Dark, empty retail space. Lit only by the painted-over
front windows. Marta edges her way in, her eyes still
adjusting from the sun.
MARTA
Hello?
Her foot hits something on the dirty concrete floor.
HER MEDICAL BAG.
She kneels, picks it up gently.
Next to where it was lying, she finds something else
curious - the burned remnants of a piece of paper. Only a
charred corner remains.
She turns her attention back to the room. Creeps forward.
MARTA (cont'd)
Hello?
Ahead - a silhouette. A person. Seated in a chair, in the
center of the room. Silent, facing her.
MARTA (cont'd)
Listen I don't know what you want.
Whatever you want we can work it out,
but we have to figure it out right
here, right now, and I'm leaving with
that report.
A beat of silence. Nothing. Something's not right here.
MARTA (cont'd)
Hello?
Marta takes a step closer, lifts her phone, and turns on its
flashlight.
Illuminating the ghostly face of FRAN, the housekeeper.
Marta, barely breathing:
MARTA (cont'd)
Fran?
A SPIDER crawls across Fran's face. Marta STIFLES A SCREAM
and leaps back, sucking in air.
A moment of stillness. Her phone BUZZES - Blanc calling.
Marta ignores the call, frozen.
Her eyes go to: A white letter sized ENVELOPE in Fran's
hand, resting on her lap.
Marta swallows. Leans in, carefully and quietly for some
reason, and SLIPS the envelope from the lifeless fingers.
Unsealed. She opens it.
It is empty.
Before this can even sink in, a rattling, grating DRAW OF
BREATH - from Fran.
Marta starts - oh my god - and goes to her, checking a
pulse, checking her eyes, lays her on her back. Fran sucks
in thin breath, her eyes finding Marta in the glare of the
dropped phone flashlight.
MARTA (cont'd)
Fran! Fran! Can you hear me? Fran,
give me a sign if you can hear me!
FRAN
You
MARTA
Me? Fran it's Marta, you called me
here, you sent me the email, I'm
here. I'm going to call an ambulance
and you're going to be ok but can you
tell me what happened, did you take
something, what's happened to you -
Weak, Fran grabs Marta's wrist, and Marta focuses on her.
FRAN
...copy... copy
MARTA
What?
FRAN
...stashed...
These words are barely given breath:
FRAN (cont'd)
you... did this... won't... get
away.. with this
Her eyes seize. Her breath gets ragged. Marta is paralyzed
with shock and fear. Fran is dying.
Marta looks at the medical bag in her hand. Then at Fran,
struggling with her final breaths, eyes wide with fear.
She takes a step back from the dying Fran. Fingers tight
around the medical bag. Letting her die.
But then, a decision: no. Marta dials 911 on speaker, drops
to her knees and starts administering mouth to mouth.
PHONE
911, what is your emergency?
