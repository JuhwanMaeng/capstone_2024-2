Scene 30: INT. LIBRARY
Back to Walt's hesitating face. The briefest of moments has
passed. Walt lies:
WALT
We talked, we had a business
discussion, about e-books, Jesus, it
was nothing. You want to talk about
an argument, hell Ransom had an
argument with him.
BLANC
Ransom, Richard and Linda's son?
WALT
Look we love Ransom, he is a good
kid, we love him.
BLANC
...but
WALT
But he's always been the black sheep
of the family, and I'm not, I, I keep
stuff like this in the family, but
with Ransom, he's never had a job.
But dad for some unknown reason has
always supported him, they've got
this love hate bond. They fight.
But that night, god. They had a blow
out.
BLANC
About what?
