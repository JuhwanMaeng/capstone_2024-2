Scene 150: INT. DRAWING ROOM
Marta jimmies the clock drawer open with a letter opener.
She pulls a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER from inside, blows loose
pot leaves off it. She hands it to Blanc.
MARTA
She practically told me where it was.
Anyway this'll tie everything up.
And I just handed it to you, god
you're you're not much of a
detective are you?
BLANC
To be fair you're a pretty lousy
murderer. Perhaps we deserve each
other.
