Scene 194: INT. LIVING ROOM
Marta sits, a blanket over her shoulders. An officer who's
just taken her statement walks away. Blanc approaches.
MARTA
Can I ask. At what point did you
suspect I had something to do with
Harlan's death?
BLANC
From the moment you first set foot in
front of me.
Taps her shoe. The tiny, faded spot of blood.
MARTA
Oh my god.
BLANC
I want you to remember something very
important: you won not by playing
the game Harlan's way, but yours.
Through the window she sees the family outside.
MARTA
I should help them. Right?
BLANC
I have my own opinion. But I have a
feeling you'll follow your heart.
He gives her a wink, and strolls off.
