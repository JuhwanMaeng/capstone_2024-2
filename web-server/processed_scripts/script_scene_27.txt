Scene 27: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Walt with a drink in his hand has cornered Harlan. Richard
watches across the room as Walt goes from arguing to
pleading.
RICHARD (V.O.)
He wouldn't leave him alone, poor
guy. Harlan had to give him the
hook.
Harlan has had enough, he takes Walt's arm and leads him
into the drawing room for a private talk.
RICHARD (V.O.) (cont'd)
I didn't hear what he said but he
must have really handed him his
lunch, Walt was like a wounded puppy
the rest of the night.
