Scene 124: INT. RANSOM'S LIVING ROOM
Ransom studies the mysterious letter. Marta pushes aside a
stack of New Yorkers and sits on the couch.
RANSOM
Well I don't know what this is from
Indicating the tag photocopy with her name.
MARTA
It's my medical bag tag. They have
my medical bag. For some reason.
RANSOM
OK, but this is just a photocopy of
the header of a blood toxicology
report, from the local crime lab. On
Harlan. Marta, it would show the
morphine overdose.
MARTA
So I'm screwed! How do you know all
this stuff?
RANSOM
I was Harlan's research assistant.
For a summer.
He sips his morning coffee.
RANSOM (cont'd)
But what kind of blackmail scheme is
this? I mean the actual evidence is
sitting up the street at the crime
lab. What was the point of sending
you this?
