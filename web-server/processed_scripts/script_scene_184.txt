Scene 184: INT. 1209 COLUMBUS ROAD - 8AM - FLASHBACK
Fran standing in the middle of the room, nervous. She turns
as Ransom walks in and strides towards her.
FRAN
I knew it. I knew you were a no good
son of a bitch, I knew Harlan
wouldn't have just killed himself.
RANSOM
Yes, you were right Fran.
Ransom sees the medical bag on the floor, kneels and pulls
something out of it.
FRAN
I knew you were guilty as shit. Now
you're gonna pay for it don't come
near me I'm warning you I -
But he's upon her, hand over her mouth, stifling her scream
as he pushes the syringe into her neck and PUSHES THE
PLUNGER.
MINUTES LATER - her inert body in the chair. He fishes
through her pockets, finds the envelope, and takes the TOX
REPORT from it, leaves the empty envelope in her hands.
On his way out: lights the tox report on fire, drops it
burning next to Marta's bag. We stay with it as it burns
away.
BLANC (V.O.)
Now the board is set. Marta will get
the blackmail note. You will put the
pieces together for her - the tox
report, her one chance at getting
away with it all. You'll guide her
to the rendezvous.
(MORE)
You'll make an anonymous call to the
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
police, they will catch her there
with the body and the burned
evidence. Marta will be arrested for
killing Fran... and Harlan.
