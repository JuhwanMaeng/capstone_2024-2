Scene 193: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE - LATER
Linda comes outside and joins the family.
Several more police cars, and an ambulance. Ransom is
loaded into the cop car. His family are held at bay by
officers, but they react in different ways -
Richard yelling at the cops. Walt sobbing, Donna collapsed
against him, Jacob on his phone.
Joni staring into space, ruined. Meg talking to Lieutenant
Elliott, crying. She's just learned about Fran.
Linda watches the circus, strangely disconnected, going to
light a cigarette. With a strange smirk, she uses the flame
to warm the blank note from the office, and HIDDEN WRITING
starts to appear - a note from her father. Their secret
communication. As the letters appear, her face changes.
