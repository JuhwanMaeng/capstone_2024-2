Scene 59: EXT. PATIO - DAY
Elliott snaps the notebook closed.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
And that's it. Everyone's stories
matched, every movement accounted
for.
BLANC
There is no other staircase up to
Harlan's room?
Blanc scratches that same spot on the side of his neck.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
No. Just the creaky one.
Blanc seems intrigued by this.
BLANC
Interesting.
TROOPER WAGNER
So I guess we can rule out Ransom, he
wasn't there. And Marta, Harlan was
alive after she left. But Meg got
home during the time of death window.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Except it was a suicide. Harlan hit
both carotids, we saw from the blood
blood splat patterns that they were
uninterrupted. Meaning, It's almost
impossible for anyone to have been
around him at the time. He's the one
that cut his own throat. I don't know
why we keep going over this.
BLANC
Physical evidence can tell a clear
story with a forked tongue.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
What?
BLANC
And as we've seen this morning,
everyone can lie. Well. Almost
everyone.
