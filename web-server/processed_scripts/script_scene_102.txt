Scene 102: INT. LIVING ROOM
JACOB
And then there was more shouting, but
I also heard Ransom say "I'm warning
you."
Walt raises his arms, triumphant.
LINDA
Ransom? What's this mean?
He just eats cookies, silent.
WALT
It means dad finally came to his
senses and cut this worthless lazy
brat out of the will.
to Ransom( )
And you better sell your little
Beamer and you better give your
notice at that country club and kick
whatever fashion drugs you're on
cause if you think after the bridges
you've burned, the shit you've said
and what you've put this family
through for the past ten years that
any of us are going to support you,
are going to give you like dad used
to say a single red dime you're nuts.
Ransom looks around the room. Cold faces.
RICHARD
Son.
RANSOM
mock gravity( )
Father?
RICHARD
Did Harlan tell you he was cutting
you out of the will?
RANSOM
Yes.
RICHARD
Then he's done what we weren't strong
enough to do - this might finally
make you grow up.
Ransom is really slapped by this but he doesn't let it show.
LINDA
I think it might be the best thing
that could happen to you.
RANSOM
Thanks - my mother, folks.
JONI
It won't be easy for you but it'll be
good. Nothing good is ever easy.
RANSOM
Up your ass Joni, you've got
your teeth bit into this
family tit so hard
MEG
Oh 'up your ass' very nice
you homophobic privileged -
RANSOM
going down the line( )
As a matter of fact - Eat shit, hows
that? In fact eat shit, eat shit -
eat shit - Definitely eat shit. Eat
shit.
And now everyone is shouting at each other.
Blanc has heard enough. He sets the baseball down on a side
table, and drifts out. Marta follows him.
