Scene 89: INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
HARLAN
I know I missed something... there's
going to be something I missed. But
I know you can beat it. Without
losing your soul you have to do what
you have to do to beat this, and win.
MARTA

HARLAN
You can and you have to. For me.
Right now.
She's out the door and he shuts it.
