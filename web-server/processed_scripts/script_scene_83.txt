Scene 83: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Harlan and Ransom go off together to have a private talk,
leaving the family having a heated conversation in the
living room.
RICHARD
I don't like him no he's an
asshole but maybe an
asshole's what we needed
oh uh huh yeah there you go
JONI
Oh god. Yeah an asshole's
what Germany needed in
nineteen thirty ever
Marta stays on the outskirts. Fran, with a tray of
champagne flutes:
FRAN
Jesus. I'm gonna disappear until the
politics talk is done. You want some
champers?
MARTA
No I'm technically working. Thanks.
Marta checks her watch. Meanwhile Donna, who's had a few, is
tearing into the family fight.
DONNA
We're losing our way of life
and our culture, there's
millions of Mexicans coming
and this isn't Joni don't
make this a race thing, I'd
say the same thing if they
were European immigrants -
we allow them in and they
think they own what's ours
JONI
Oh god really - yeah it's
not a race thing yeah
Oh yeah, if the Swiss were
clogging in the streets -
They're putting. Children.
In cages. I mean these are
camps.
RICHARD
Nobody's saying that isn't
bad, but I blame the parents
JONI
For wanting a better life
for their kids, isn't that
what America
RICHARD
For breaking the law. You're going
to hate hearing this but it's true,
America is for Americans. Marta, come
here.
Richard beckons her over, waving his cake plate. We've seen
this moment before, silent, during Richard's questioning.
LINDA
Oh god don't.
Marta is drawn over next to Richard, very uncomfortable.
RICHARD
No, Marta your family came from
Uruguay but you did it right, she did
it legally, I'm saying. You work
hard, and you'll earn your share from
the ground up just like dad and all
of us did - Marta I bet you agree
with me.
LINDA
Leave the poor girl alone.
RICHARD
No Marta do you agree, I'd like you
to answer - you wanna become an
American, there are legal ways to do
it, but if you break the law it
doesn't matter if you have a good
heart, you gotta face the
consequences.
At that moment booming shouts begin behind the study door -
Harlan and Ransom going at it. Ransom bursts out.
Marta takes the opportunity to slip into the hallway, alone.
She breathes hard. Takes a champagne flute from the tray.
Drinks it in one gulp.
