Benny look I hear what you are saying
Trooper Wagner quickly shushs Elliott, enthralled by every

The body was discovered early the
next morning. The police, the
medical examiners, the family,
everyone swarms in,
to Ransom( )
and there is no possible way you can
get to Marta's medical bag to remove
the vials. You must wait for your
moment, when the investigation is
over and you know the house will be
empty. And that is why you missed
the funeral.
