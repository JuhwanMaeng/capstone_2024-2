Scene 151: INT. LIVING ROOM
The family gathered, impatient. Lieutenant Elliott and
Trooper Wagner are there too, with another uniformed
officer. Ransom sits in the corner, his face passive.
Marta gulps. Blanc is a few steps behind her. As she
speaks, he unfolds and reads the tox report.
MARTA
Um. You guys have always been good
to me. And what I'm about to say
isn't going to be easy, and you're
going to be upset, but especially
after everything you've gone through
the past few days, I thought you
deserved to hear it from me.
Walt smiles at her, "you're doing the right thing." Marta
takes a deep breath.
Blanc has finished reading the report. He refolds it
carefully.
MARTA (cont'd)
I -
BLANC
Excuse me. You have not been good to
her. You have all treated her like
shit to steal back a fortune that you
lost and she deserves. You're a pack
of bloody vultures at the feast, but
you're not getting bailed out, not
this time.

Ms. Cabrera has decided definitively
not to renounce the inheritance.
WALT
What?
MARTA
What?
BLANC
Furthermore it will be my
professional recommendation to the
local authorities that the manner of
death in the case of Harlan Thrombey
is ruled as suicide, and the case is
closed.
RANSOM
What?
MARTA
What? No, Blanc - BLANC
Thank you all for coming
goodbye.
He firmly guides Marta out by the elbow. A beat of silence.
RICHARD
Is anybody else confused?
As the family breaks out in hubub, Linda notices her dad's
OLD BASEBALL on the side table where Blanc left it. What's
that doing here? She picks it up.
