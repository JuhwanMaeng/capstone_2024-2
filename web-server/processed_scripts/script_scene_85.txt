Scene 85: INT. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT
Empty and dark, fireplace blazing. Above the fireplace is
an ornate mantle clock. Fran uses a key to unlock one of
several tiny drawers hidden in its face, takes out a joint
and hands it to Meg.
FRAN
Take em whenever you need em -
they're just drying out since you
gave me that Juul.
MEG
Thanks Fran.
Fran leaves them alone.
MARTA
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
sorry
MEG
Stop saying you're sorry
Jesus
Meg lights the joint.
MARTA
God my heart won't stop, I can't -
it's just everything, no, thank you
she refuses the joint, then realizes where it came from.
MARTA (cont'd)
That's where Fran keeps her stash?
MEG
Who's going to open a clock?
