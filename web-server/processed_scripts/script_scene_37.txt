Scene 37: INT. SMALL STUDY - DAY OF PARTY
Harlan at his desk, toying with the same old baseball. This
is a thing he does at his desk. Joni standing, arms crossed.
JONI
The school hasn't got the check yet,
I don't know why Alan didn't mail it
HARLAN
Alan didn't mail it because he caught
a discrepancy. Alan's office has
been wiring tuition directly to the
school, as per your request. But
Phyllis's office that handles your
yearly allowance has been wiring the
tuition money directly to you as
well. As per your request. You've
been double dipping Meg's tuition,
stealing from me. A hundred thousand
dollars a year. For the past four
years.
Harlan shows Joni a letter from his business manager, with
transaction receipts attached.
JONI
Harlan. I don't know how this mix up
happened but
Harlan opens his ledger, hand writes a check.
HARLAN
I'm writing this tuition check, then
that is the last money you or Meg
will get from me.
JONI
Please you don't understand
HARLAN
I know it'll hurt but it's for the
best.
Joni's speechless, her face frozen. Harlan puts the
baseball down and detaches the check, holds it out to her.
HARLAN (cont'd)
My mind's made up.
