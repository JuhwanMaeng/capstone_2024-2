Scene 170: INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - AFTERNOON - FLASHBACK
Ransom bounds up the stairs, climbs under the POLICE TAPE
blocking Harlan's study, and enters.
BLANC (V.O.)
there is no one home to wonder why
you're going into Harlan's study. Or
so you think.
Fran comes around the corner, spots Ransom and is about to
say something, but doesn't.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
Poor Fran. She witnessed you
tampering with Harlan's medication in
the medical bag. She did not know
what you were doing. But she knew
you were up to no good. And so her
mind begins to turn.
Ransom pockets the two incriminating vials from the medical
bag and replaces the Naloxone pen. When he stands to go she
retreats.
