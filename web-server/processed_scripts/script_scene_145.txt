Scene 145: INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - LATER
Marta and Blanc sitting silently in the fluorescent-lit
waiting room. Marta with her face in her hands. Blanc is
on his phone, mostly listening.
BLANC
listens( )
Alright my friend, thank you for the
update. No I'm here with her. No
need for that, I'll bring her in once
we get word that the housekeeper is
stable. It's still touch and go.
listens( )
Alright.
He hangs up. Marta looks at him.
MARTA
This is over. People are getting
hurt. I'm going to tell you the
truth.
BLANC
Young Ransom just told Lieutenant
Elliott everything. Who just told me
everything.
MARTA
Good. Wait god I hope he
didn't cover for me, did he
tell the real truth, about
me switching the-
And the disguise and all
the-
And the blackmail with the-
BLANC
Yeah
Yes
Mm.
MARTA
But why did Fran take my morphine?
Obviously she had swiped my bag from
the house, but she didn't seem like a

needed money...
beat( )
I dunno, doesn't matter. I should
tell the Thrombeys myself, I feel
like I owe that to them.
BLANC
I don't think that's a good idea
MARTA
No, I need to do it. I won't do any
of this if I can't do that. I really
need to. I gave the doctors my
number, they'll call if anything
changes with Fran.
BLANC
We'll round up the Thrombeys at the
house, along with a police escort.
MARTA
For the arrest after.
BLANC
You can tell me your whole story on
the drive over. I want no more
surprises.
Marta stands, a dead man walking, resigned.
