Scene 48: INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
Marta and Harlan vanish up the stairs towards the third
floor, while Richard and Linda head into the bedroom right
next to the stairs. Down the hallway Joni waves, and ducks
into another bedroom.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Marta took Harlan upstairs to give
him his meds, Richard and Linda and
Joni went right to bed. Now we do
have this: the stairs leading up to
Harlan's bedroom and his attic office
creak horribly.
