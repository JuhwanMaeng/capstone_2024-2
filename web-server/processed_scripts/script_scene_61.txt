Scene 61: INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
The night of the party. A clock on a nightstand: 11:32.
Off screen we hear Marta leading Harlan up the creaky
stairs.
MARTA
Up up up up - you got it? HARLAN
I got it. Up up up I got
it.
Marta enters the room, and behind her we see Harlan keep
climbing up the narrow stairs to his office.
MARTA
Up up nooooo no not tonight, no
straight to bed tonight it is soooo
late c'mon. Harlan. Harlan!
She grabs a med kit from the bedroom and follows him,
exasperated.
