Scene 42: INT. FOYER
Marta sits alone, across from a portrait of Harlan. Muffled
voices out on the patio. Cigar smoke drifts by outside.
She creeps over to the glass door. Puts her ear to it.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (O.S.)
You ask me to drag all these good
people back for questioning, go over
it all again, I don't get it. This
is a pleasant family with the usual
quarrels but no possible motives for
murder - where are you going?
At that moment, BLANC's face appears right next to Marta's
staring right at her through the distorted glass. She yelps
and falls back.
