Hey! Excuse me ma'am. Are you with

granddad's nurse, she's with us.
"The help?".
MARTA
to the cop( )
It's ok, sorry.

mutters( )
No. It's not ok. What the
hell?
They hug, and are both instantly crying. They laugh.

Not very good. Alone, lots of just,

Anything you need, you're part of
this family Marta.
MARTA
Thank you.
