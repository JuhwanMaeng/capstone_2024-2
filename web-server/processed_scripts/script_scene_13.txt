Scene 13: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY - FLASHBACK
Warmly lit, classic rock playing, food laid out. Linda and
Richard mingle happily with the rest of the family (who
we'll meet shortly.)
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Did anyone besides the family show
face?
LINDA (V.O.)
Uh. There was Fran, the
housekeeper. Marta, Harlan's
caregiver, good girl, hard worker.
Family's from Ecuador. And Wanetta -
Greatnana, Harlan's mom.
At the snack table wearing a dozen coats, a woman who might
be three hundred years old. She pounds down chips and dip
like a machine.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
wow( )
His mom? How old is she?
LINDA (V.O.)
We have no idea.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Okay, Your son Ransom, was he there
as well?
LINDA (V.O.)
Yes but he left early.
RANSOM DRYSDALE, roguishly handsome in his early 30s,
breezes out the side door, past Greatnana.
GREATNANA
Ransom, are you leaving?
