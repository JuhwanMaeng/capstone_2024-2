Scene 97: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD
The group hikes up out of the woods, towards the low wall
with a small pedestrian gate that leads to the east lawn.
Marta is out in front. During the following, she notices
something: The earth around and under the gate is soft and
bare. And clear as day: HER FOOTPRINTS from the other
night, the only ones from women's shoes. The same ones she
has on now. Her breath catches. SHIT.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Any luck with - whatshisname?
TROOPER WAGNER
Ransom. No, but we have an address.
Ten Kenoak street.
BLANC
Ten Kenoak. That's a pleasant thing
to say. kenoak. I awoke amid
Kenoak.
TROOPER WAGNER
Ugh this mud, my boots are going to
stink.
BLANC
Mud - has it rained the past week?
No - Nobody move! Freeze! Everyone!
These footprints must not be
disturbed!
sees( )
Marta!
Marta has already walked through the pedestrian gate and up
onto the lawn, stepping in her pre-existing prints. She
turns back, playing dumb.
MARTA
What?
BLANC
Don't - stop there, don't -
MARTA
I can't hear you, what?
She trots back to them through the gate, stepping into her
returning prints.
BLANC
No no no no don't - don't step on
the, ok, alright. Aughhhhh ok.
MARTA
What?
Blanc sidesteps up to the gate, not stepping in the mud.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Alright, Wagner let's get the boys on
it, check the prints, tape off this
area, keep it clear.
The dogs come running down the lawn, barking at the men.
They tear through the gate, further messing up the mud.
MARTA
Hey boys, easy. Hey. Hey.
She pets them and they quiet down.
BLANC
Best judge of character is a dog.
I've found that to be true.
The dogs start BARKING and bolt towards the house, where
Richard and Linda are pulling up in their lux SUV.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
They're doing the will reading at
ten, whole family will be here soon.
Elliott heads up towards the house. Blanc meanders up the
lawn, and Marta follows.
MARTA
I've never been to a will reading.
BLANC
You think it'll be like a game show.
No. Imagine a community theater
performance of a tax return.
They approach the side of the house. Blanc does a gentle,
meandering study of the layout.
Marta steals a look at the trellis she climbed.
Oh no. A piece of the white lattice trellis that broke off
when she was climbing - about eight inches long - lies in
the grass beneath it. Her eyes dart up - yup, there's the
broken spot. Shit.
BLANC (cont'd)
SWEET BEANS
Marta starts - did he spot it? No - he's come face to face
with Greatnana, standing stock still on the porch. She
stares at him like a bird.
BLANC (cont'd)
Good morning Mrs. Thrombey.
He approaches her, slowly. When his back is fully turned
Marta takes her shot and KICKS the piece of trellis under
some thick bushes at the base of the house.
Blanc and Greatnana stare at each other. Blanc gets very
close to her, great sympathy in his eyes. Greatnana stares
back. It's almost like they're communicating. This goes on
for a little too long. Then Blanc breaks from the trance,
and turns to Marta.
BLANC (cont'd)
Do you think you could handle the
study?
