Scene 81: INT. LINDA'S ROOM
Linda stands in her childhood room, by the window in the
ebbing light. From a shelf she pulls a stack of PINK
NOTECARDS, identical to the one Harlan showed Richard in his
office. But these are covered in writing, sweet little
notes, a father to his daughter.
WALT (O.S.)
Hey sis. People are going to start
getting here for the memorial pretty
soon. Are you- Are you alright?
She looks up. Walt in the doorway. She wipes her eyes,
indicates the notes.
LINDA
I was just thinking about Dad's
games. This all feels like one, it
feels like something he'd write, not
do. I keep waiting for a big reveal,
where it all makes sense. How nice
would that be?
Her little brother hugs her. His eyes tired and dark.
