Scene 129: INT. MARTA'S CAR
Marta peeking up through the window.
Blanc sees her. She sees him. Ducks back down. Shit.
RANSOM
You know what this means right? If
you destroy that copy you are totally
within the clear.
Blanc begins to walk straight towards Marta. Quickly and
with purpose. Shouts something, Lieutenant Elliott follows.
RANSOM (cont'd)
Marta. Did you hear me.
Marta peeks again - Blanc coming at them full speed. Twenty
paces from the car. Closing in fast.
MARTA
Yeah.
She sits up, throws the car in gear and FLOORS IT.
