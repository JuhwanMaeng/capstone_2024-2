Scene 118: INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM
Marta stumbles in - Alice in front of the TV, mom pacing.
MOM
subtitled Spanish( )
Oh my god Marta what is all this,
what did you do?
The TV is tuned to local news - an anchor stands outside
THEIR APARTMENT BUILDING.
LOCAL NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
...we again we don't know much about
Marta Cabrera or the exact
relationship she had to Harlan
Thrombey, beyond being his home
nurse, and the Thrombey family has
yet to release a statement...
MARTA
Is that here?
ALICE
Oh yeah it is. Wait so is that true?
Are we rich?
Marta looks out the blinds - several local reporters down in
the streets with their vans and cameras.
MARTA
Oh my god.
