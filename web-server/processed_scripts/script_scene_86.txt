Scene 86: INT. LIVING ROOM
Walt yells at a non responsive, bored Greatnana.
WALT
DO YOU WANT DINNER, NANA?
DINNER? TO EAT? EAT?
LINDA
Walt she's fine, she ate the
whole salmon spread already.
Meg grabs Walt, pulls him to Marta.
MEG
Did you tell Marta yet? What we all
talked about?
WALT
No, not yet, is now a good
time?
MEG
Yes a very good time. Right
now.
WALT
Marta. We've talked it over, and
wait( )
Have you been smoking grass?
MEG
No.
WALT
We talked it over and the whole
family, we want to take care of you.
MARTA
What does that mean?
MEG
We all think you deserve something.
WALT
Financially, we want to help you out.
You were never anything but good to
dad. Because of that, you can count
on us.
Walt embraces her, Meg puts a hand on her back.
Over Walt's shoulder, Marta sees Harlan's portrait again.
Has its expression changed? It looks like it has a slight
conspiratorial smile. Marta breathes - maybe this is all
going to be ok.
WALT (cont'd)
I thought you should have been at the
funeral, by the way. I was outvoted.
