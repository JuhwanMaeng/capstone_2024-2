Scene 163: INT. LIBRARY
Marta is stunned, she can't even process this.
MARTA
No, no that's impossible.
BLANC
It is the truth. Hand me that vial
of morphine, I'll show you.
Blanc has placed two identical vials on the table behind
Marta. Her mind is still spinning, she glances at them,
takes one and absently hands it to him.
MARTA
If he did that, if the meds were
switched, then when I got them mixed
up... oh my god( )
I accidentally switched them back.
But then I gave Harlan
BLANC
The correct doses. Yes. But not
accidentally. I taped over the
labels of these two vials.
Blanc shows white tape over the one she just handed him.
Picks up the other vial, shows the same.
BLANC (cont'd)
The vials themselves are identical.
How did you know that this was the
morphine?
MARTA
I... just knew
BLANC
You knew because there is the
slightest, almost imperceptible
difference of tincture and viscosity
between the liquids. You knew
because you had done it a hundred
times. You gave him the correct
medication. Because you are a good
nurse.
MARTA
Then Harlan was...
BLANC
I'm sorry Marta. But yes. Harlan
was perfectly fine.
He unfolds the tox report and hands it to her.
BLANC (cont'd)
His blood was normal. The cause of
death was truly, solely suicide, and
you are guilty of nothing but some
damage to the trellis and a few
amateur theatrics. In fact if he had
listened to you, he would be alive
today.
Marta is white as a ghost. She shudders, buckles over.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Hot damn.
BLANC
A twisted web, and we are not
finished untangling it. Not yet.
