Scene 106: INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING
Blanc looks down the "dead end" hallway. Marta joins him,
out of breath.
BLANC
Show me, but don't step on the
carpet.
It's a runner rug, and Marta delicately steps on the wood
siding as she goes to the wall with the painting. And swings
it open, revealing the window.
TROOPER WAGNER
It's the trick window! From "A Kill
For All Seasons!"
Elliott and Wagner at the top of the stairs, and Blanc
motions them not to approach.
BLANC
Off the carpet!
He drops down to his knees, removes a loupe from his jacket,
and holds it in his eye. Then, his face inches from the
carpet, he scans it. All the way to the window. Then
stops.
BLANC (cont'd)
Traces of dried mud. I suspect they
go the length of the hallway.
MARTA
Footprints?
BLANC
No, just traces.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Depending on when it was last
cleaned, it could be from anytime
BLANC
But that would not explain this.
He motions to the base of the window sill - obvious scuffs
of dried mud. Marta winces.
Blanc tosses the piece of trellis to Elliott.
BLANC (cont'd)
Analyze this mud. It will match these
traces, and you will find similar
samples leading up the trellis on the
side of the house.

On the night of the party, somebody
who did not want to be heard climbing
the steps went to a great deal of
trouble to break into Harlan
Thrombey's rooms. The game is afoot,
eh Watson?
