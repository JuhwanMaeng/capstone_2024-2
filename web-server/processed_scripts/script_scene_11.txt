Scene 11: INT. FOYER
Thrombey's eldest daughter Linda opens the door for Marta.
LINDA
How you doing kiddo.
Linda is 60ish, well put together, sharp and steely eyed.
She dresses and speaks with just a little more sharpness
than any situation she's in requires.
MARTA
Hi Linda. How are you?
LINDA
Ueuh. The funeral helped. I guess.
Just seeing him. I thought you
should have been there. I was out
voted.
Linda's husband Richard walks in, on the phone. Same age as
Linda, gruff and confident, will put his feet up on
anything.
RICHARD (ON PHONE)
I'm not the cop so I don't know.
Alright fine, don't come, get
arrested. Die up your own ass all I
care. hangs up( )
He's not coming.

RICHARD (ON PHONE) (cont'd)
Ransom. Little shit. Missed the
funeral.
STATE TROOPER WAGNER, fresh faced in his 30s, pokes his head
in through a door.
TROOPER WAGNER
Excuse me, we're ready for you now,
we'd like to see you one at a time.
LINDA
Alright I'll go first. I'm assuming
this will all be wrapped up before
the memorial tonight.
TROOPER WAGNER
We'll do our best ma'am.
Linda exits with Wagner, leaving Richard and Marta.
RICHARD
So. How you doing kiddo.
