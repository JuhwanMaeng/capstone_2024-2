Scene 135: EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
Marta's car PEELS TO A STOP and the two COP CARS on either
side blaze by, hitting their brakes.
She pulls off onto a SIDE STREET and into narrower city
streets, down narrow alleys, using her small car to nimbly
dart though small spaces.
The cops can't follow, and she loses them.
She pulls to a stop in a secluded little back lot.
