Scene 191: INT. LIBRARY
For the first time, Ransom looks afraid.
RANSOM
Fran's alive?
Marta's phone starts to ring. They all see the caller id -
it's the hospital.
BLANC
to Marta( )
Oh yes. Fran, who will confirm this
fairy story or something close to it.
to Ransom( )
And will send you, Hugh, to jail.
She answers the call, puts the phone to her ear.
MARTA
Yes.
A long beat, then her face breaks in relief.
MARTA (cont'd)
Yes. Thank you doctor, that's great
news, we'll be there soon.
She hangs up. And smiles with radiant joy.
MARTA (cont'd)
She's okay.
to Blanc( )
She's ready to talk.
Ransom stares at Marta, his face a mask.
BLANC
Trooper Wagner, if you would keep Mr.
Drysdale in custody while Lieutenant
Elliott, Ms. Cabrera and myself go to
the hospital to take Fran's
statement.
Ransom stands. Steps to Marta, who's frozen, looking in his
eyes. His poker face breaks. And he grins.
RANSOM
I want to say this just to you, not
to a courtroom of cameras, just to
you because you know it's the truth:
we allowed you into our home. We
allowed you to take care of granddad,
to be part of our family and now you
think you can steal it from us? You
think I'm not going to fight for our
birthright, our home, our ancestral
family home?
BLANC
Harlan bought this house in the
eighties. From a Pakistani real
estate baron.
RANSOM
Oh shut up Blanc, shut up! Shut up
with that Kentucky fried fog horn
rag-horn drawl. Yeah I killed Fran
but I guess I didn't, so what do you
have on me. Nothing
What? attempted murder -
to Blanc( )
I get arson for the bombing, maybe a
few other charges, with a good lawyer
I'll be out before you know it.
Face to face, Ransom's face hateful, Marta's strong and set.
RANSOM (cont'd)
to Marta( )
And then you'll see just how much
hell I can wreak on your life, you
vicious little bitch.
But then... Marta's face starts to do things. Odd things.
Convulses. Her jaw clenches. Her cheeks bulge.
And the PROJECTILE VOMITS into Ransom's face.
RANSOM (cont'd)
AUGH! WHAT THE SHIT!
He falls back cursing, she drops to her knees, spitting.
Wagner, inappropriately excited:
TROOPER WAGNER
That means she was lying!
MARTA
That's right, Fran's dead.
to Ransom( )
And you just confessed to her murder.
Ransom takes this in. Then he smirks.
RANSOM
Well. In for a penny...
In one fluid motion he spins to the ornamental WALL OF
KNIVES, grabs one -
BLANC
No!
and TACKLES MARTA...
Time slows as Blanc and Elliott lunge to stop him but it's
too late -
Ransom and Marta fall together, his arm arcing down
And as the they hit the ground his arm comes down
PLUNGING THE KNIFE UP TO THE HILT IN HER CHEST.
They lie still, breathing hard. Her eyes wide with pain and
horror. His cold and wild.
But then she blinks. Squints.
And he cocks his head. Realizing something.
Withdraws the knife from her chest.
Its fake blade had retracted into the handle. It's a
theatrical prop.
He pumps it up and down a few times, the spring making a
pathetic toy noise.
Ransom smirks.
RANSOM
Shit
And is VIOLENTLY TACKLED out of frame by Trooper Wagner.
Leaving Marta lying on her back. Blanc shouting if she's
alright, Elliott and Wagner wrestling Ransom into cuffs, it
all fades into the background as she holds the knife and
stares at the ceiling.
