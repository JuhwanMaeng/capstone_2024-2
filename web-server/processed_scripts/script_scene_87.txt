Scene 87: EXT. SIDE PORCH - NIGHT
Later. Marta comes out to get some air. Exhales deeply.
And then jumps - she's not alone. Benoit Blanc sits in a
wicker chair in the dark, smoking a long thin cigar.
MARTA
Wah ha. Detective. You're still here?
BLANC
Mm.
Silence. Blanc smokes and stares at Marta. Marta shifts.
MARTA
Did you know Harlan?
BLANC
He knew my father who was a police
detective. Years ago. My father
respected Harlan. That says quite a
lot.
MARTA
So that's why you're here?
BLANC
Here now here? No. I stayed hoping
to speak to you a little more.
MARTA
Uh?
BLANC
Something is afoot with this whole
affair. I know it, and I believe you
know it.
MARTA
So you're... going to keep digging.
BLANC
Harlan's detectives they dig, they
rifle and root, truffle pigs. I
anticipate the terminus of gravity's
rainbow.
MARTA
Gravity's Rainbow.
BLANC
It's a novel.
MARTA
I know. I haven't read it.
BLANC
Neither have I. Nobody has. But I
like the title. It describes the
path of a projectile, determined by
natural law. Voila, my method. I
observe the facts without biases of
the head or heart, I determine the
arc's path, stroll leisurely to its
terminus, and the truth falls at my
feet. beat( )
The medical examiner was ready to
rule this a suicide, but Elliott
agreed to keep it pending for forty
eight hours. Tomorrow morning I
search the grounds and the house,
begin my investigation. I want you
to be by my side for it. My
confidant, my eyes and ears.
MARTA
What but - why me?
BLANC
I trust your kind heart. Also you
are the only one who had nothing to
gain from Harlan's death. So.
Watson.
Blank puts out his cigar, stands.
MARTA
You want my insight into this family?
None of them are murderers. That's
my insight.
BLANC
And yet. Be it cruel or comforting,
this machine unerringly arrives at
the truth. That's what it does.
MARTA
Always?
He does a little bow.
BLANC
Tomorrow at eight.
Marta watches him go.
