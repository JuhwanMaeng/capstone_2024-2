Scene 14: INT. LIBRARY
The strange man in the linen suit taps a piano key, as if
reminding to ask him something.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Right, did all three of you show up
at around the same time?
LINDA
N...o, Richard came early to help the
caterers set up.
She raises a questioning finger to ask about the man but
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Okay and you and your husband Richard
work for a real estate firm in
Boston?
LINDA
sharp( )
It's my company.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
checks notes( )
Sorry. Right.
LINDA
I built my business from the ground
up.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Just like your dad. You two were very
close?
LINDA
We had our own secret way of
communicating. You had to find that
with dad. You had to find a game to
play with him. And if you did that,
and played by his rules...
CUT TO: Richard in the chair Linda was in, giving his
statement.
RICHARD
Everyone idolizes their dad, right?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I don't know, do they?
RICHARD
Very much not, don't know why I said
that. But Linda does.
