Scene 116: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Marta realizes the connection's dead, holds the phone in her
hand like something delicate she just broke.
RANSOM
Ok then. Did the detective find
anything suspicious at the house?
MARTA
in a daze( )
Mud. Tracks upstairs - where I broke
in through the window.
Ransom winces.
RANSOM
Identifiable prints?
MARTA
No.
RANSOM
Good. Ok. Good. Hey. You've just
gotta ride the next few days out
until the investigation putters out,
cause it will, cause no matter how
sharp this Blanc guy is he's got
nothing. Relax.
