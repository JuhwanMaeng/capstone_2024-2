Scene 16: INT. LIBRARY
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Seems like all his kids are self made
overachievers.
Richard makes a "...sure" face.
RICHARD
Sure.
CUT TO:
WALT THROMBEY now sits in the questioning chair. Late 40s,
softly obsequious in a sweater and loafers. His leg is in a
cast.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
For the record, I'm speaking to Walt
Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's youngest
son.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (cont'd)
So you run your father's publishing
company?
WALT
Yeah. It's my - it's our, it's the
family's publishing company, dad
trusts me to run it. 30 languages,
over 80 million copies sold. A real
legacy. You guys fans?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I don't do much fiction - TROOPER WAGNER
BIG fan. Big.
TROOPER WAGNER (cont'd)
His plots, like something like "A
Thousand Knives," with the - I don't
want to spoil it but - the cow and
the shotgun, like where do you come
up with that?
WALT
Dad said the plots just popped into
his head fully formed, that was the
easy part for him -
TAP from the linen suit man's finger.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
You live in town, right? You guys
probably arrived at around the same
time?
Walt looks at Linen suit, thrown.
WALT
Uh. We all got here around 8.
