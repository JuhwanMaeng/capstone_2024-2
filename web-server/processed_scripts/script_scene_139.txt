Scene 139: INT. MARTA'S CAR
Marta glances at the dashboard clock - 9:55. Blanc, casual:
BLANC
Strange case from the start. A case
with a hole in the middle. A donut.
I'm just talking through my process
here, let me know if this is boring.
Marta's arms are locked, her eyes steal a glance at the
clock - 9:58.
BLANC (cont'd)
I feel the noose tightening - the
family are truly desperate.
(MORE)
Desperate motives, the mystery of who
BLANC (cont'd)
hired me, the impossibility of the
crime, and yet -
Up ahead, a street sign - "Columbus Road." Marta tenses.
BLANC (cont'd)
A donut! One central piece, and if it
reveals itself the fog would lift,
the arc would resolve, the slinky
become unkinked
MARTA
Do you mind if I stop for a second. I
need to pick something up. It will be
very quick.
BLANC
Sure.
