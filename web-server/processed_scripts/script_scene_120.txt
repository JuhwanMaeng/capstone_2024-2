Scene 120: INT. GREATNANA'S ROOM
Dim. By an open window stands GREATNANA. Blanc enters, she
turns. They look into each others eyes.
BLANC
Good Morning Mrs. Thrombey.
A long pause as he thinks of exactly the right word.
BLANC (cont'd)
Why is grief the providence of youth?
I don't know. But I'd imagine that
age deepens all feelings. Including
grief. This was a long walk to
offering condolences for the loss of
your son. And asking you if it isn't
presumptuous of me to not think too
harshly of your family, if I am as I
suspect the first to console you.
They're young aren't they.
Blanc sits.
BLANC (cont'd)
One thing I do assume of age is
weariness. Damned if I don't get
more tired every day. Tired of what
I do. Following arcs, like lobbed
rocks. The inevitability of truth.
But the complexity and the gray lies
not in the truth but what you do with
the truth once you have it.
Greatnana's eyes move slightly.
BLANC (cont'd)
I think you have something you want
to tell me. I think you're very
perceptive and very capable of
telling me what you saw the night of
your son's party. But I'll happily
wait. I'm in no rush. I find it
quite pleasant. Sitting here with
you.
He reclines, not particularly looking at her. She looks
back at him. Every now and then a breeze stirs the window
sheers.
