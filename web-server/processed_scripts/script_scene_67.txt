Scene 67: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Marta looks up the side of the looming house. A sturdy
trellis on the wall, and high above a third story window.
HARLAN (V.O.)
You've got to get up to the third
floor without being seen, and the
only way is to climb the side trellis
and come in through the trick hall
window.
MARTA
You've gotta be kidding me.
HARLAN (V.O.)
I am not. Do it.
Cut to: moments later, Marta climbing the trellis. It's
easy going until a piece BREAKS under her foot, and she
swings for a second by one hand.
HARLAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
And for godssakes don't make any
noise.
