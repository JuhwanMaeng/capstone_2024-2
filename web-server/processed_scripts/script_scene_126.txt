Scene 126: EXT. MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE
The cop car pulls past an identifying sign into the parking
lot of a one story stand alone building, joining several
other cop cars, and fire trucks. Journalists kept at bay.
The building is a charred brick husk. Black smoke, debris.
It's been gutted with an explosion and a blazing fire.
Blanc steps out of the cop car and finds Lieutenant Elliott.
BLANC
What's the cheese?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Five AM, security systems here was
all triggered. It went up quick.
Blood stores, records, all gone. No
employees around, thank god.
BLANC
Any surveillance cams?
Elliott gestures wearily to the charred remains of a
security camera on the smoking shell of an awning.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
And speaking of security, the
security tape from the Thrombey
residence was scrambled. For some
reason.
Blanc unsurprised. He motions back to the building.
BLANC
What was still pending from the
autopsy?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
The report on the blood work.
BLANC
Blood work?
Blanc chews on this.
Across the street, Marta and Ransom pull up in her car.
