Scene 121: INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM
MOM
Lawyers were here, very big lawyers
it looked like, and some other guys I
didn't know, they left all this for
you and business cards, so many
business cards, and there was a pile
of other stuff when I got home -
Mom shovels some official looking legal letter and courier
envelopes into Marta's arms.
MOM (cont'd)
subtitled Spanish( )
Hey. I don't like this.
MARTA
subtitled Spanish( )
I don't like it either mom. I'm
slipping out the back - I'll be back
later, don't talk to anyone.
