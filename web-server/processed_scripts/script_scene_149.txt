Scene 149: INT. FOYER
Marta and Blanc enter. This really feels like a walk
towards the gallows. Richard, Walt and Meg are there. Meg
avoids eye contact with Marta.
RICHARD
Ah. Ok, has she come to her senses?
WALT
She's standing right there Richard
she can speak for herself -
BLANC
Is the rest of the family here?
WALT
In the living room. BLANC
I think maybe, if we
could...
Blanc beckons, and Richard and Walt file out. On her way
out Meg hugs Marta, weeping.
MEG
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry I told them
about your mom. I was angry and
scared, I'm sorry
MARTA
It's ok, Meg. I understand. Believe
me. It's alright.
Meg sniffs, dries her eyes.
MEG
God I am so raiding Fran's stash
after this.
They hug one more time. Then when Meg walks off towards the
living room, Marta realizes something. Blanc walks back.
BLANC
I still think this is a bad idea, but
the family is assembled.
MARTA
to Blanc( )
I know where the tox report is.
