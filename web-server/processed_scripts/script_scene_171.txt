Scene 171: INT. LIBRARY
MARTA
Oh god that movie she told me about,
with Danica McKellar, that's what she
was talking about -
TROOPER WAGNER
Deadly by Surprise.
BLANC
She loved Harlan. She hates Ransom.
So the poor girl decides to test her
theory and make this asshole pay.
She gets a copy of the toxicology
report, I will be honest I have no
idea how
MARTA
She has a cousin - she told me, she
has a cousin who works as a
receptionist at the examiners office!
BLANC
Well voila. The numbers mean nothing
to her, but if Ransom is guilty its
existence is a threat, so she
photocopies the header and makes her
blackmail note.
MARTA
So why did she send it to me?
BLANC
She did not. She sent it to Ransom.
