Scene 76: EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT
Marta shimmies down the last of the trellis.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Leave the way you came. And don't.
Be. Seen.
She hops to the ground, then FREEZES and almost shouts.
She's facing a darkened first floor window. Wide open. And
inside it, staring RIGHT AT her, is Greatnana.
Marta is frozen. Greatnana isn't moving either. Just has
her eyes locked on Marta.
After what seems like forever, Greatnana cocks her head
slightly and asks...
GREATNANA
Ransom? Are you back again already?
Marta breathes. And backs away. Then turns and goes,
quickly, down across the lawn.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Drive home. Sometime in the next few
days the police will question you.
