Scene 45: EXT. PATIO - DAY
Back to our scene. Marta looks queasy, tries to stall.
MARTA
Heh - Richard? - affair? Heh.
BLANC
A yes or no will do.
She struggles, her jaw clenched, face working hard, then
attempts -
MARTA
.....no
And immediately VOMITS into a nearby planter.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Whoa! TROOPER WAGNER
Oh my god!
They all rush to her, Blanc brings water, awfully concerned.
BLANC
Dear girl I'm sorry. I assumed you
were speaking figuratively.
Blanc takes the shortest acceptable beat of concern before
turning to Elliott.
BLANC (cont'd)
Quite something. But I was obviously
right, Richard is having an affair,
his father in law found out and
confronted him. "You tell her. Or I
will."
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Even if it's true... you ok?
Marta gives a weak thumbs up, recovering
ELLIOTT
Even if that was right, protecting
his marriage is weak sauce as a
motive.
BLANC
Well. And then there is... Joni.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Joni? TROOPER WAGNER
Joni?!
TROOPER WAGNER (cont'd)
Lifestyle guru Joni? No. Harlan was
supporting her and her daughter, she
had the opposite of a motive.
Marta tries to quietly slip back into the house
BLANC
And if that support was threatened?
Miss Cabrera one moment please
MARTA
I'm just going to go get some Scope
BLANC
Miss Cabrera, was Harlan planning on
cutting off Joni's allowance?
Off Marta's "oh god no" face:
