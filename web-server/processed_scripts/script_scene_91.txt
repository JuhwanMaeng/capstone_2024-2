Scene 91: INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
MARTA
Harlan I have to get you help -
Harlan reclines on the couch in the middle of the room,
ornate dagger against his throat. Marta's eyes go wide.
HARLAN
Do what I say and everything's going
to be ok, Marta. I promise.
She makes a move to stop him and with one quick motion he
DRAWS THE DAGGER across his throat. Blood sprays.
She leaps back, hands to her mouth, spins and leaves the
room, closing the door behind her.
