Scene 114: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Beer bottles now stacked up in front of Ransom. Marta has
just told Ransom everything. He stares into space, and
makes the slightest hint of a laugh which I'll write as:
RANSOM
Heuh.
MARTA
I know, just saying it it sounds
insane but it's all true. I think
Blanc's been on to me from the
start - I don't care if I go to jail,
but my mom... my sister, we can't -
Nothing but silence from Ransom. Maybe he's deep in
thought. A strange glint in his eye.
MARTA (cont'd)
You going to say something?
RANSOM
I always thought I was the only one
who could beat Granddad at GO. I
always thought that meant something.
MARTA
I know you did.
RANSOM
At the party, that night, my last
conversation with him, our last
fight, that's what he told me, about
you. That you beat him nearly every
time. More than me. And I thought
what a strange thing to tell me. But
I think I get it now. I think it did
mean something.
beat( )
I'm not telling the family shit.
You're not going to jail. That
detective is not going to catch you.
And you're not giving up the family
fortune. (MORE)
Think about what Granddad did to see
RANSOM (cont'd)
this through, this was what he wanted
not just for you but for his family,
and for him. And yes for you.
You've come this far. Let me help you
go all the way.
Marta looks at him hard.
MARTA
This isn't you. You could turn me in
right now and get your cut of the
inheritance. Why?
RANSOM
Because fuck my family. They don't
deserve any of this. I can help you
and we can fool them all and get away
with it... and then you will give me
my cut of the inheritance. The
perfect ending, we all win. You, me
and Harlan. Deal?
Silence. Broken by Marta's phone ringing. On the phone
ID - "MEG T"
Marta takes a breath, looks at Ransom. And picks it up.
MARTA
Meg
MEG (ON PHONE)
Marta. Oh that was nuts. MARTA
I know
MEG (ON PHONE)
Are you ok?
MARTA
Yeah are you?
MEG (ON PHONE)
I'm fine, I mean everyone's nuts,
they're all going, I don't know,
they've lost it. No one knows I'm
calling you, I wanted to - I don't
know what I wanted, I wanted to say
sorry for how everyone was.
MARTA
No... MEG (ON PHONE)
And... I guess I wanted to
ask...
beat( )
What are you going to do?
MARTA
What do you mean?
MEG (ON PHONE)
Well the... with the, will. What are
you going to do?
Marta looks at Ransom. What indeed.
MARTA
What do you think I should do?
MEG (ON PHONE)
You should do what you think is...
right. I think you should give it
back to us. Granddad always took
care of us, we're his family, I know
he was like family to you but we're
his actual family. Marta you know
this isn't fair, we've always been
good to you and we're going to take
care of you, everyone loves you and
you're like family and we'll take
care of you but you have to make
things right, you know what's right.
Marta, keeping eye contact with Ransom. Then, her voice
quavering, Meg drops what is for her the big bomb:
MEG (ON PHONE) (cont'd)
Marta, mom's broke, she says I'll
have to drop out of school.
MARTA
No, no. I won't let that happen.
beat( )
Whatever money you need Meg, I'll
help you. I don't want you to worry.
